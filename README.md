## Aims

Promote understanding of Citizen Journalism & Open Knowlege/Data

Citizen journalism, open data & FOI are important partners in the future of a modern democracy. Journalists, researchers & bloggers need information to enhance scrutiny of public officials and institutions. Open data and open knowledge principles are the key to providing that information to the public through journalism (whether mainstream, independent or crowd sourced). People need to see these principles at work to undertand their value and need to be given opportunities to engage and contribute.

For their part, citizen journalism and open data projects also need volunteers, supporters and funders to exist and play the important role they must fulfill.

Citizen journalism also has a role to play in improving the quality and engagement with democratic principles through public discourse. Technology and the internet has brought about unprecedented access to public discourse but this debate is characterised by an adverserial culture which inhibits meaningful dialogue between people of different political pursuasions. A tendency to oversimplify and try to out-shout one's political opponents is a major turn off for many people, inhibiting understanding and reducing engagement with the political sphere. This disengagement undermines formulation of representative and responsive public policy.
